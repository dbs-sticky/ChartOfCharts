# Chart Picker
This is my chart picker, created in Excalidraw and designed to help you pick a suitable chart based on your dataset. The most 'fleshed out' section is probably the distribution section, as that's the chart type I was most concerned with while creating the chart picker. 

To open **chart-picker.excalidraw** please use the [Excalidraw app](https://excalidraw.com/).

This chart picker is based on the excellent Chart Chooser developed by the good people at [ExtremePresentation](https://extremepresentation.com)
